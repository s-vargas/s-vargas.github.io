I am a fifth-year Government and Politics PhD student at the University of Maryland studying American Politics and Methodology. My primary interests are race and ethnic politics, identity, political behavior, and political socialization. My current work focuses on the interactions between political socialization and the political behavior of second generation immigrants in the US. I achieved my Master's degree in Government and Politics from UMD in 2024. Prior to UMD I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Florida in Political Science and Anthropology. In my personal life I enjoy watching shows, weightlifting, running, and exploring the DC area!
