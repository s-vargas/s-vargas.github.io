My Time at the Washington Post
======
Within the University of Maryland's Government and Politics department, the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement offers a fellowship with the Washington Post. Every now and then one PhD student from our program may apply for this role and if chosen, work for the Washington Post as a polling team fellow for 10 weeks. This time around I was the student chosen to work with the polling team on polling curation, data validation, writing content for articles, and more. Here I will keep a list of links to pieces I helped with or even wrote!
