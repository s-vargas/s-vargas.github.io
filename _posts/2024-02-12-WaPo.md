# My Time at the Washington Post

Within the University of Maryland's Government and Politics department, the [Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement](https://cdce.umd.edu/) offers a fellowship with the Washington Post. 
Every now and then one PhD student from our program may fill this role and work for the Washington Post as a polling team fellow for 10 weeks. This year I was chosen out of multiple applicants to work with the polling team on polling curation, data validation, writing content for articles, and more. Here I will keep a list of links to pieces I helped with or even wrote!
