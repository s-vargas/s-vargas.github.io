Within the University of Maryland's Government and Politics department, the [Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement](https://cdce.umd.edu/) offers a [fellowship](https://cdce.umd.edu/news/there%E2%80%99s-bsos-team-taking-pulse-american-opinion) with the Washington Post. 
This year I was chosen out of multiple applicants to be the 5th polling fellow under this 10-week program. Under the polling team I will work in a fast-paced environment on survey curation, data analysis and validation, writing content for articles, and more. Here I will keep a list of links to pieces I helped with or even wrote!
